# Sitcom Soulmates

Sitcom Soulmates is a personality quiz to determine good relationship compatibility with TV characters.

## Project Origins

The inspiration for this project derives from a scene in "One Last Ride," the series finale of "Parks and Recreation." Tom Haverford, after losing his successful business in a recession ("Who could have known the world would run out of beef?") rebuilds his life as an author and motivational speaker. He guides his readers on their path to leadership. Such paths come from a personality quiz in which your result provides your leadership type. Based on your traits, your leadership will align with the type that closely models that of the friends and coworkers Tom has met along the way. 

I thought this concept highlighted the capability for anyone to be successful, even if their traits were atypical of the leaders we normally see. Everyone has potential, even if they don't fit the mold! Years later, this quiz was created to determine the same personality type, but to connect someone on their path to personal relationships, rather than professional success! 

On a personal note, television has long been a way for me to connect with others. I started working on this project a year into the COVID-19 pandemic. That time at home really made me realize that when locked in our homes for the majority of the day, under such crazy circumstances, a lot of people retreated into the familiarity and comfort of sitcoms. We all know and love these characters, but if we were to truly enter their world (rather than just visit them through our TV screens), who would we connect with most? The answer might surprise you! 

## How It Works 

Each question comes with seven potential responses, with seven corresponding personality types: 

* "A" responses correspond with the Leslie personality type
* "B" responses correspond with the Ron personality type
* "C" responses correspond with the April personality type
* "D" responses correspond with the Andy personality type
* "E" responses correspond with the Ben personality type
* "F" responses correspond with the Donna personality type
* "G" responses correspond with the Tom personality type

The more you have of a certain letter, the more likely you'll end up with that personality type! The results page provides the user with their relationship match, based on couples from both Parks and Recreation as well as other sitcoms of the 21st century, like "New Girl," "The Office, and "How I Met Your Mother." 


## How the Results Work 

In the inspirational scene, each leadership personality is given three corresponding characteristics. These same characteristics are used for your personality type in this quiz. Your corresponding matches are b

Your corresponding relationship match is based on who you would have the most chemistry with, based on corresponding pairings in other sitcoms. Each character result was put up against the three characteristics of each personality type, and given a corresponding type. As a result, you'll see "Leslie" results matched with "Ben" results, and "Andy" results matched with "April" results. 

Your corresponding friendship match is based on who would have answered similarly to you! If you fall under the "April" personality type, you'll see other sitcom characters who would have answered similarly to you on your list of potential friendships. 


## Where Does the Code Come In 

This project uses HTML and CSS, and acts as my personal introduction to the essential world of Javascript. The Javascript offers a more dynamic toggle through of the quiz; rather than providing a single page of questions and answers, the user gets to glide through a slideshow (with the ability to go back and change their answers)! The Javascript also provides certain requirements for a successful result (IE, you cannot skip questions).

The results are calculated using a "mode" calculation. Each answer is given a corresponding number (A = 1, B = 2, etc.) put into a list. The submit button toggles a calculation to determine which number appeared most in the list. That result is your corresponding personality type! 


## Challenges and Hopeful Future Adjustments 

This quiz offers eight questions, allowing for the certainty of a mode. However, there is an impractical solution for a "tie" situation. A person could, technically, answer with three C's, three D's, and an A, and their result will default to which mode result occurred first (IE, if someone answers CCDCDDA, their personality result will be that of C, April). I would like to expand this project to include more questions, and more room for tie-breaker questions to provide a more carefully calibrated result! 


## Conclusion 

This was a very fun quiz to make, and I hope that it makes someone smile. If it acts as a gateway to your next favorite show, then I've succeeded!
